## Description

- Develop a website for the Arizona Spurs supporter club to help promote the organization.
- When the user first visits the website, then they are able to view a summary of the group and their mission.
- When the user clicks on the history link, then a page appears showing the history of the group.
- When the user clicks on a significant event on the history timeline, then a brief description and corresponding photo appears.
- When click on the shop link, then the user is taken to a page showing the various items available to purchase from the organization.
- When in the shop and click on a specific item, then a more detailed page of that item will appear.
- When viewed on different screen sizes, then the view is rendered to accomodate the different sizes.
